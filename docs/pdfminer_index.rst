What's It?
-----------------

PDFMiner is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents. Unlike
other PDF-related tools, it focuses entirely on getting and analyzing
text data. PDFMiner allows one to obtain the exact location of text in a
page, as well as other information such as fonts or lines. It includes a
PDF converter that can transform PDF files into other text formats (such
as HTML). It has an extensible PDF parser that can be used for other
purposes than text analysis.
